It's been a while since I last blogged on my
[Wordpress](https://kbseah.wordpress.com/) site.

In the meanwhile I've jumped on and off the Twitter bandwagon. It was fun and I
got to know some cool people there along the way, but I think the negatives
have come to outweigh the positives.

So I'm starting to blog again in one-way, broadcast only mode, to keep track of
thoughts that I might want to come back to later, and also to exercise the
writing muscle from time to time. But mostly so I can close some of the dozens
of open tabs in my browser without worrying that I've lost something Really
Cool that I wanted to come back to.
