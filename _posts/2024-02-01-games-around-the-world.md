A few months ago, the author of a site called [Ways to
Play](https://games.porg.es/) got in touch with me via my [Learn
Teochew](https://learn-teochew.github.io/) website to ask about figuring out
the original Teochew for a phrase that was quoted in translation, relating to a
game known under various names, in English as [Nine Man's
Morris](https://games.porg.es/games/nine-mens-morris/#:~:text=%E7%9B%B4%E7%9B%B4),
in Teochew 直直 (dig8 dig8).

Ways to Play is a fascinating overview of traditional games played around the
world, mostly but not limited to card games and board games. It's clearly a
labor of love by the author George Pollard. It's great to see his dedication to
detail; venturing down deep Internet alleyways to hunt down scraps of
information, where a less fastidious compiler would probably have thought a
translation is good enough, no need for the original.

This links nicely to a similar website I came across recently, dedicated to the
Chinese gambling game of [Hua Hui](https://onebadworld.fr/cheefah/), also
spelled Wha-Whey, Hua-Hoey, etc. I first found this while tidying up a
[Wikisource
transcription](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Journal_of_the_Straits_Branch_of_the_Royal_Asiatic_Society/Volume_16/A_Description_of_the_Chinese_Lottery_known_as_Hua-Hoey)
of an 1885 article on Hua Hoey gambling, which caught my attention because I
had actually heard of Hua Hoey before, while researching the [biography of my
ancestor Seah Eu Chin](https://seaheuchin.info/influence_02_03.html).

Seah Eu Chin was among a group of 19th century Chinese merchants in Singapore
who petitioned the Governor to ban Hua-Hoey gambling in 1870. Their wish was
granted in the Gaming Houses Ordinance passed by the Legislative Council of the
Straits Settlements. A few years later, however, they again petitioned the
Governor for an amendment to the ordinance, which presumed that any house with
suspicious bars or fittings could be presumed to be a gambling house and be
raided by the authorities - as landlords they were afraid that they could be
prosecuted because of what their tenants were doing without their knowledge...

At the time I did not probe further into the details of Hua-Hoey gambling, so
it is now gratifying to now have learned more about it.
